<h1 align="center">IOS App Exchange Rate Calculator</h1>

<h3 align="center">About</h3>
<p align="center">
    This IOS application is an exchange rate calculator that helps you calculate the amount of money converted between countries. I came up with this idea of creating this app is because I'm an American and I do have family who lives overseas which I visit occasionally. I wanted to create this IOS App so when I do visit my family abroad and if I wanted to know how much a price of something cost, I could then use this app I've created to help me find the amount of something would cost.

<h3 align="center">How I built this IOS App?</h3>
<p align="center">

This entire App was built using Swift and I designed the UI using Xcode's main story board. To bring in the data of a specific country to be converted into, I used a public API. All these data was stored in as a JSON object and have to parse through these data in order to get the country name and the rate for the app's conversion calculation. The public API I used to retrieve information from was from a site https://fcsapi.com/ .

<h3 align="center">Future Improvements</h3>
<p align="center">

There are some improvements that I wanted to improvement upon. Currently, my IOS app can only use European pound as the starting base conversion. I felt that this is an inconvenience because there is no way for the user to switch to another starting conversion base if the user of the app want to start the conversion from a different country. When I was building this App, I took this scenario into account but I wasn't able to find any free API online that allowed me to give the user an starting base conversion and the option of choosing a starting base will cost me.
