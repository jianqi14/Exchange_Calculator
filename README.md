<h1 align="center">IOS App Exchange Rate Calculator</h1>

<h3>About</h3>
<p align="center">
    This IOS application is an exchange rate calculator that helps you calculate the amount of money converted between countries. I came up with this idea of creating this app is because I'm an American and I do have family who lives overseas which I visit occasionally. I wanted to create this IOS App so when I do visit my family abroad and if I wanted to know how much a price of something cost, I could then use this app I've created to help me find the amount of something would cost.

<h3>How I built this IOS App?</h3>
<p align="center">
    To built this app, I used an API to get the country name and the rate for a country the app user wants to convert to. All these info was stored in a JSON. The public API I used is from https://fcsapi.com/ .
